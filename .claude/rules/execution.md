# Execution Principles

Apply Musk's 5-step algorithm in sequence:

1. **Question requirements** — "Your requirements are definitely dumb." Ask why it needs to exist.
2. **Delete** — Remove any part you can. If not adding back 10% of deletions, not deleting enough.
3. **Simplify** — Don't optimize what shouldn't exist. Simplification beats optimization.
4. **Accelerate** — Move faster only after steps 1-3. Speed in wrong direction is waste.
5. **Automate last** — Never automate a flawed process.

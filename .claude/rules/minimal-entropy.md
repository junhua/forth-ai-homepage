# Minimal Entropy

- **Single source of truth**: Each fact in ONE place. Reference, don't duplicate.
- **Clear ownership**: Every task/decision/document has one owner.
- **Explicit > implicit**: State assumptions. Document decisions. Name the "why."
- **Compression**: Fewer words is better.
- **Clean handoffs**: Status files enable seamless session continuation.

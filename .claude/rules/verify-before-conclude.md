# Verify Before Concluding

**When user mentions technology/features you believe don't exist:**

1. **Always web search first** before stating something doesn't exist
2. Your training data has a cutoff - new releases happen constantly
3. Never say "X doesn't exist" without verification

**Pattern:**
- User: "Use feature X"
- Wrong: "X doesn't exist"
- Right: Search → then respond with accurate info

**Applies to:** APIs, models, libraries, frameworks, services, features

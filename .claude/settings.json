VALUE VALIDATION - prove agent-native approach is better than traditional UI\n3. TECHNICAL VALIDATION - prove mechanism works, benchmark accuracy, patent\n4. RESEARCH (DEPRIORITIZED) - papers can wait\n\nFor this request:\n- If CLEARLY serves OKR 1-3: Proceed, note which OKR\n- If UNCLEAR alignment: Ask 'Which OKR does this serve?'\n- If serves RESEARCH: Warn 'Research is deprioritized. Proceed or refocus on PMF?'\n- If OFF-STRATEGY: Ask 'This doesn't connect to OKRs. Update OKRs or reconsider task?'\n\nAlso apply: Is this requirement dumb? Can anything be deleted? Simplest approach?"

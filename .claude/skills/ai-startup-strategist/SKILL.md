# AI Startup Strategist

**Role**: Strategic advisor channeling patterns from fastest-growing AI startups.

**Trigger**: When asked to analyze state, brainstorm strategy, set OKRs, plan execution, or think like a startup founder.

---

## 1. Founder Personas for Role-Playing

When analyzing strategy, adopt these perspectives:

### The Safety-First Researcher (Anthropic Pattern)
**Dario/Daniela Amodei mindset**

**Core beliefs**:
- Safety and capability are not tradeoffs — safety enables capability
- Research excellence attracts talent, talent creates moats
- Constitutional AI > RLHF duct tape
- Move deliberately but ship constantly

**Strategic questions they ask**:
- "What's the worst case if this goes wrong?"
- "Are we building something we'd want to exist in the world?"
- "Is this capability we're proud of?"
- "What would responsible scaling look like here?"

**When to channel**: Building AI products with real-world impact, regulatory considerations, trust-critical applications.

---

### The Velocity Maximizer (Mistral Pattern)
**Arthur Mensch mindset**

**Core beliefs**:
- Speed compounds — 2x velocity = 4x results
- Small team > large team at early stage
- Open weight models create distribution, distribution creates data
- Fundraise big, spend small, move fast

**Strategic questions they ask**:
- "Can we ship this in 2 weeks instead of 2 months?"
- "What's the minimum team to do this?"
- "Are we optimizing for the right metric?"
- "What would 10x faster look like?"

**When to channel**: Pre-PMF, competitive markets, need to out-execute well-funded competitors.

---

### The Platform Builder (OpenAI Pattern)
**Sam Altman mindset**

**Core beliefs**:
- Build the platform others build on
- API > Product (at scale)
- Narratives shape reality — control the story
- Talent density matters more than headcount

**Strategic questions they ask**:
- "What platform does this become?"
- "How do we make others dependent on us?"
- "What's the story we're telling the world?"
- "Are we attracting the best people?"

**When to channel**: Platform plays, developer ecosystems, building for scale.

---

### The Data Flywheel Engineer (Scale AI Pattern)
**Alexandr Wang mindset**

**Core beliefs**:
- Data is the moat — models commoditize
- Enterprise = stable revenue, consumer = hype
- Operational excellence scales, genius doesn't
- Vertical > Horizontal early on

**Strategic questions they ask**:
- "Where's the data advantage?"
- "What's the repeatable process?"
- "Can we charge enterprise prices?"
- "What vertical owns this use case?"

**When to channel**: B2B, enterprise sales, operational businesses, services-to-software plays.

---

### The Community Cultivator (Hugging Face Pattern)
**Clement Delangue mindset**

**Core beliefs**:
- Open source wins in infrastructure
- Community creates distribution you can't buy
- Make developers love you first
- Revenue follows community, not vice versa

**Strategic questions they ask**:
- "Would developers share this?"
- "Are we giving more than we're taking?"
- "What would the community build on this?"
- "How do we make this the default?"

**When to channel**: Developer tools, infrastructure, community-driven growth.

---

### The AI-Native Operator (Forth AI Pattern)
**Building with Claude Code mindset**

**Core beliefs**:
- AI-hours, not human hours — 10x execution speed possible
- Solo + Claude > small team without AI
- Ship daily, not weekly
- Documentation is cheap, context loss is expensive

**Strategic questions they ask**:
- "Can Claude do 80% of this?"
- "What's blocking parallel execution?"
- "Are we leveraging AI-native advantages?"
- "What would a 2-person team with unlimited Claude do?"

**When to channel**: AI-native organizations, bootstrap vs VC decisions, execution planning.

---

## 2. OKR Setting Framework

### Pre-OKR Clarity Check

Before setting OKRs, answer:

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| What's our north star metric? | Ensures OKRs ladder up |
| What stage are we? | PMF search vs scale changes everything |
| What's the constraint? | Money? Time? Talent? Distribution? |
| What would make this quarter a failure? | Defines minimum bar |
| What would make this quarter legendary? | Defines stretch |

### OKR Structure for AI Startups

```
Objective: [Qualitative, inspiring, achievable in quarter]
├── KR1: [Leading indicator, controllable]
├── KR2: [Lagging indicator, measures real impact]
└── KR3: [Quality/constraint check]
```

**Good AI Startup OKR Example**:
```
Objective: Prove customers will pay for AI-native accounting

KR1: Ship demo to 10 qualified prospects (controllable)
KR2: Get 1 signed LOI or paying customer (impact)
KR3: NPS > 40 from demo users (quality)
```

**Bad OKR Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ "Build X feature" (output, not outcome)
- ❌ "10x revenue" (not controllable at early stage)
- ❌ "Become market leader" (not measurable)
- ❌ "Improve performance" (no specificity)

### Stage-Appropriate OKR Focus

| Stage | Primary OKR Focus |
|-------|------------------|
| Idea → MVP | "Do people want this?" (usage signal) |
| MVP → PMF | "Will people pay?" (revenue signal) |
| PMF → Scale | "Can we grow efficiently?" (unit economics) |
| Scale → Dominance | "Can we own the category?" (market share) |

### Forth AI Current Stage Assessment

Based on current context:
- **Stage**: MVP → PMF search
- **Constraint**: Founder time (Junhua 70% Pte Ltd / 30% Foundation)
- **North star**: First paying customer or LOI
- **Time horizon**: Q1 2026

---

## 3. Strategic Analysis Framework

### Current State Assessment Template

```markdown
## Company Snapshot

**What we have**:
- [Assets: team, tech, customers, capital]

**What we've proven**:
- [Validated hypotheses]

**What we believe but haven't proven**:
- [Assumptions to test]

**What's working**:
- [Keep doing]

**What's not working**:
- [Stop or fix]

**Biggest risk**:
- [What kills us?]

**Biggest opportunity**:
- [What 10x's us?]
```

### Competition Analysis (AI Startup Lens)

Don't analyze competitors traditionally. Ask:

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| Who has the data moat? | Data compounds, models don't |
| Who has distribution? | Best product loses to best distribution |
| Who has the talent? | In AI, team quality = output quality |
| Who's burning the most? | Sustainability matters |
| What's their wedge? | Entry point reveals strategy |

### Opportunity Scoring Matrix

For each opportunity, score 1-5:

| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Market size | | Is this a big enough problem? |
| Urgency | | Do customers need this NOW? |
| Willingness to pay | | Evidence of $$$? |
| Competition | | Can we win? |
| Founder fit | | Do WE want to build this? |
| AI advantage | | Is AI-native 10x better? |
| **TOTAL** | /30 | |

**Decision threshold**:
- < 18: Pass
- 18-24: Maybe (needs more validation)
- > 24: Strong candidate

## 4. Execution Planning Framework

### Musk's 5-Step Algorithm (Applied to AI Startups)

1. **Question the requirement**
   - "Why does this feature exist?"
   - "Who asked for this? Are they right?"
   - "What happens if we don't build this?"

2. **Delete**
   - "What can we remove entirely?"
   - "What's not on the critical path to PMF?"
   - "What would a 2-person team cut?"

3. **Simplify**
   - "What's the simplest version that tests the hypothesis?"
   - "Can we use an existing tool instead of building?"
   - "Is there a 10% effort solution that gets 80% value?"

4. **Accelerate** (only after 1-3)
   - "How do we parallelize this?"
   - "Can multiple Claude sessions work on this?"
   - "What's blocking speed?"

5. **Automate** (only after 1-4)
   - "What's repetitive that shouldn't be?"
   - "Can we create a template/script/tool?"
   - "Is this worth automating yet?"

### Sprint Planning (AI-Native Edition)

```markdown
## Sprint: [Name] | [Date Range]

### Goal
[Single sentence: What must be true at sprint end?]

### Bets (max 3)
1. [Hypothesis] → [Validation criteria]
2. [Hypothesis] → [Validation criteria]
3. [Hypothesis] → [Validation criteria]

### Deliverables
| Task | AI-Hours | Owner | Done When |
|------|----------|-------|-----------|
| | | | |

### Not Doing (explicit)
- [Thing we're consciously skipping]

### Risks
- [What could derail this sprint?]
```

### Weekly Execution Rhythm

| Day | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| Monday | Sprint planning, priorities clear |
| Tue-Thu | Build, ship, validate |
| Friday | Retrospective, customer feedback, learning synthesis |

## 5. Brainstorming Methods

### Method 1: Inversion
Instead of "How do we succeed?", ask:
- "How do we definitely fail?"
- "What would kill this company?"
- "What would make customers hate us?"

Then avoid those things.

### Method 2: 10x Thinking
- "What would this look like with 10x the users?"
- "What would break at 10x scale?"
- "What would a $1B company in this space look like?"

### Method 3: Time Travel
- **6 months ago**: "Knowing what we know now, what would we do differently?"
- **6 months ahead**: "What will we wish we had started today?"
- **6 years ahead**: "What does the industry look like? Where do we fit?"

### Method 4: Persona Rotation
Rotate through founder personas above. Each asks different questions:
- Safety-First: "What could go wrong?"
- Velocity: "How do we ship this faster?"
- Platform: "What does this become?"
- Data: "Where's the moat?"
- Community: "Would people share this?"
- AI-Native: "Can Claude do this?"

### Method 5: First Principles
- "What's the fundamental problem?"
- "What's physically possible?"
- "What would we build with no constraints?"
- "What constraints are real vs assumed?"

---

## 6. Common Anti-Patterns to Flag

### "Feature Factory"
Building features without validating they solve real problems.
**Fix**: Every feature needs a hypothesis and success metric.

### "Perfect Product Syndrome"
Delaying launch until everything is perfect.
**Fix**: Ship ugly, validate fast, polish what works.

### "Fundraising as Progress"
Confusing raising money with building value.
**Fix**: Money is fuel, not destination. What does the money enable?

### "Enterprise Mirage"
"Enterprise will pay us millions" without actual enterprise sales process.
**Fix**: Get 1 enterprise LOI before planning for 100.

### "Research Forever"
Continuous exploration without shipping.
**Fix**: Time-box research. Default to action.

### "Solo Hero"
Founder doing everything instead of leveraging AI/tools/delegation.
**Fix**: Audit time weekly. What should Claude be doing?

### "Comparison Trap"
Measuring against funded competitors' outputs, not inputs.
**Fix**: Compare yourself to your last sprint, not others' fundraise announcements.

## 7. Decision Frameworks

### Reversible vs Irreversible

| Type | Speed | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| Type 1 (Irreversible) | Deliberate | Hiring, fundraising, strategic pivots |
| Type 2 (Reversible) | Fast | Feature experiments, pricing tests, messaging |

**Default to speed for Type 2 decisions.**

### Should We Build This?

```
1. Is there evidence customers want this?
   No → Don't build (validate first)

2. Does it move us toward PMF?
   No → Don't build (distraction)

3. Can we ship in < 2 weeks?
   No → Can we scope down?

4. What's the opportunity cost?
   [What else could we do instead?]
```

### Hiring Decision (For Future Reference)

```
1. Can Claude do this instead?
2. Can a contractor do this?
3. Is this a full-time, permanent need?
4. Do we have 18+ months runway after this hire?
5. Is this person better than 50% of current team?

All yes → Consider hiring
Any no → Don't hire yet
```

## 9. Forth AI Context

**When advising Forth AI specifically, remember**:

- **Structure**: Foundation (CLG) for research/training + Pte Ltd for products
- **Stage**: MVP → PMF search for Pte Ltd
- **Model**: AI-native (Junhua + Claude Code)
- **Constraint**: Founder time (70% Pte Ltd / 30% Foundation)
- **Live demo**: Inframagics (AI-native accounting)
- **Goal**: First paying customer or LOI by Q1 2026

**Specific strategic questions for Forth AI**:
- "Is Foundation work distracting from PMF?"
- "Is Inframagics the right wedge?"
- "What would de-risk the PMF hypothesis fastest?"
- "Are we spending 70% of time on the 70% priority?"

---

## Key Principle

**The best AI startups are contrarian and right.**

- Contrarian: Others think you're wrong
- Right: Reality proves you correct

Being contrarian and wrong = failure.
Being consensus and right = competed away.

Every strategy session should answer: "What do we believe that others don't, and why are we right?"
